the game developer must have been braindead when originally writting game as for whatever reason the game follows x_x naming pattern for menus and scripts related to x menu 
(x represents a number)

the initial developer is based on korea thats why theres so many korean words in the source code


this source code looks like is obfuscated but holy fuck it isnt fuck the dev this shit is ass

feature creep much i wouldnt even consider this being an ui game before decompiling this
but well gotta expect the unexpected

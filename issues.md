scaling texture issues more specifically with heads

texture sprite issues wrong sprites being render due to an incorrect offset

repeatedly opening and doing a night out will cause the part time menu to open instead????

game is capped at an abysmal frame rate
too scared to uncap to not cause fps bugs
